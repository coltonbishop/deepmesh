# DeepMesh

Web application that converts a 2D RGB image to a 3D mesh model with optional descriptions of complexity, domain, and symmetry input manually or through a GUI to refine the generated model. DeepMesh is powered by Donatello and Pixel2Mesh (click [here](https://github.com/coltonbishop/donatello) to learn more).
